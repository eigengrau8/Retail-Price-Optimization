# Retail-Price-Optimization

Our task is to develop a model that predicts the optimal price for a product based on various factors. This prediction would enable us to make an informed decision when pricing a product, leading to maximized sales and customer satisfaction.

The dataset's diverse features like product details, order details, pricing, competition, time etc provide a comprehensive view for our price optimization task.

By analyzing this information, we aim to predict the optimal price for retail products. This would aid in making strategic pricing decisions, thereby optimizing retail prices effectively.
